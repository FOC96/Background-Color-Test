            <h1>Can the Apple TV 4K be a cord-cutter's only streaming device?</h1>
            <p>Horaczek, S. (2017). <i>Can the Apple TV 4K be a cord-cutter's only streaming device?</i>. https://www.popsci.com/apple-TV-4K-review</p>

           <p>I cut the cable cord roughly three years ago and I’ve never regretted it. I have, however, accumulated a small village of set-top boxes, media sticks, Chromecasts, gaming consoles, and just about any other HDMI-connected rectangle that can spit out a Netflix stream. For the past two weeks, however, I put all of them on hold and committed fully to the Apple TV 4K. At $179 (for the 32GB model, the 64GB box pushes the price to $200), it costs almost twice as much as the excellent Roku Ultra, which means it should do just about everything the average cord cutter desires.</p>

           <h2>What’s new?</h2>

           <p>The outside of the box is pretty much identical to its predecessor, minus the inaccessible USB-C port that used to be on the back for service purposes. Inside, however, things have changed. The box is built around Apple’s A10X Fusion processor, which it also uses in the iPad Pro. This is a two-generation jump up from the A8 found in the previous model, which is where that 4K-pushing power comes from.</p>

           <p>The connections have been upgraded as well, including a Gigabit Ethernet port, Bluetooth 5.0, and 2.4GHz and 5 GHz Wi-Fi bands. I tried both wireless and wired connections and found the hardline connection was, unsurprisingly, faster and more reliable. The wireless works as well, it just sometimes required a little more waiting for things to load, especially if others were streaming on the network.</p>

           <p>The new TVOS 11 update adds some functionality of its own, but it’s nothing you can’t also get on the cheaper and older versions. You can now pair AirPod headphones with an Apple TV, which is nice, but also a lot less practical than the simple headphone jack baked into the remote of the Roku box.</p>

           <h2>Picture and sound quality</h2>

           <p>When you feed the Apple TV 4K the high-res, HDR content it craves, it looks and sounds fantastic. It’s as good or better than any other streaming box I have used. The high-dynamic range colors pop, especially using the Dolby Vision tech. Oddly, in terms of sound, the Apple TV 4K isn’t compatible with Dolby Atmos, which is currently one of the most popular audio platforms for home theater.</p>

           <p>The Apple TV 4K upscales content that isn’t up to its quality requirements when necessary, but you can still tell the difference between the native high-res content. This upscaling allows the Apple TV to stay in Dolby Vision mode, regardless of content. It can be a little confusing, but Apple says it prevents compatibility errors and weird screen glitches caused by switching signal types. If that’s the case, then it works because I didn’t have any issues in that regard. You will, however, probably notice some 1080p content doesn't look perfect. The difference is minimal, but if you're a stickler for things like digital noise in a picture, it may bug you.</p>

           <h2>Content availability</h2>

           <p>This is where things get tricky if this is your only cord-cutting solution. Right now, the iTunes store has an impressive selection of 4K HDR content available for $20 to purchase or $5.99 to rent if you want new releases. There are sales, though, and I rented Kong: Skull Island for $3 and got to enjoy the full HDR display. You also don’t have to pay extra to upgrade movies you already own to get the best possible picture.</p>

           <p>The biggest negative right now, however, is the lack of Amazon content, but Apple says compatibility is coming in the next few months. But, even then, you’ll have to buy the content from a computer or your phone, and then watch it on the Apple TV because purchases are iTunes only. This isn’t new for Apple users, but it’s still inconvenient. Same goes for other services like Vudu.</p>

           <p>YouTube is another outlier in that you’re capped at 1080p, even though there’s a lot of 4K and beyond content up on the service. The issue can be chalked up to a codec incompatibility that likely won’t be solved anytime soon, so this isn’t the box for you if YouTube is a primary content source (for that Chromecast would be a good choice).</p>

           <h2>Conclusion</h2>

           <p>When I first started writing this review, the most obvious comparison was to the Roku Ultra, which is so much cheaper that it seemed unfair. But, using the Apple TV 4K more made me realize that the two are very different in reality. While the Roku’s compatibility with different services is superior, it lacks access to the iTunes store, which is actually the best place to get 4K HDR new releases, at least for the moment. The Apple TV 4K also has access to a wide breadth of apps from the App Store, so it offers entertainment beyond things you can watch.</p>
